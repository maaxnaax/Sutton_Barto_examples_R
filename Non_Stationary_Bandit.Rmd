1st, we build a bandit class, and a method for pulling the bandits lever to return some reward.  Each bandit has its own mean and standard deviation to control its reward.

```{r}

bandit <- setClass("bandit", slots = representation(mu = "numeric",st =  "numeric") )

b1 <- bandit(mu = 0, st = 1)
# b1@mu # use the at symbol to access the classes attributes.
# b1@st 

pull_lever <- function(mu, st){
# Shell for setMethod
}

setMethod("pull_lever", "bandit", 
          function(mu,st){
            # print(mu@st)  # why tf does this work??
            # print(mu@mu)
            # s <- pull_lever(mu,st)
            return(rnorm(1,mean = mu@mu, sd = mu@st))
          })


pull_lever(b1)

```


```{r}

```
